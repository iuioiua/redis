[![JSR](https://jsr.io/badges/@iuioiua/redis)](https://jsr.io/@iuioiua/redis)
[![CI](https://github.com/iuioiua/redis/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iuioiua/redis/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Fast, lightweight [Redis](https://redis.io/) client built upon the
[Web Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

```ts ignore
import { RedisClient } from "@iuioiua/redis";
import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert/equals";

const redisConn = await Deno.connect({ port: 6379 });
const redisClient = new RedisClient(redisConn);

const reply1 = await redisClient.sendCommand(["SET", "hello", "world"]);
assertEquals(reply1, "OK");

const reply2 = await redisClient.sendCommand(["GET", "hello"]);
assertEquals(reply2, "world");
```

## Features

- Capable of handling 1000s of requests per second.
- More than 12x smaller than the next major Redis client in Deno.
- Supports RESPv2, RESP3, raw data, pipelining, pub/sub, transactions and Lua
  scripts.
- Compatible with all major JavaScript runtimes including
  [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/),
  [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the browser!
- Cleanly written to be easily understood and debugged.
- Compatible with timeouts and retries.
- Encourages the use of actual Redis commands without intermediate abstractions,
  resulting in fewer moving parts.

## Known issues

### Replies containing CRLF

This package currently doesn't correctly read replies that contain CRLF (`\r\n`)
within the message. For example, if a bulk string contains a CRLF, it'll only
return the message, up to that CLRF. The simple workaround for this is to use LF
(`\n`) for delimiting newlines, instead of CRLF.

## Design

Like Italian cooking, the design of this package is defined by what it doesn't
do rather than what it does do, and relies upon high-quality building blocks. It
doesn't extend the functionality of a TCP connection. It doesn't implement a
method for each Redis command, of which there are hundreds. Instead, the Redis
client consumes a TCP connection, lets the user write Redis commands, and
returns the parsed result according to the RESP data type. The result is a
design with fewer moving parts, fewer bugs, less maintenance, and a smaller
footprint than other JavaScript implementations of Redis clients.
